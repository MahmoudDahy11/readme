## About This Project

This is a **real-world client project** I designed and built end-to-end for a garment manufacturing factory. The client needed to replace a fully manual, paper-based workflow covering worker payroll, thread inventory, client orders, and machine maintenance — with a reliable digital system that works without internet.

The core challenge was building something that **non-technical factory staff could operate daily**, while maintaining production-grade code quality behind the scenes.

> ⚠️ Source code is private (proprietary client work). This README documents architecture, technical decisions, and outcomes for portfolio purposes.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Offline-First?
The factory floor has unreliable connectivity. A network-dependent app would be unusable. The decision was to make **local SQLite the source of truth** and treat Firestore as a passive backup — not the primary data layer. This means zero latency on reads/writes and full functionality with no internet.

### Why Clean Architecture?
This was a conscious decision to future-proof the codebase. The domain layer has zero Flutter/Firebase dependencies — business logic is entirely framework-agnostic. This made it straightforward to, for example, swap the local DB from Drift to another SQLite wrapper without touching a single use case.

### Why Bloc + ValueNotifier (not just Bloc)?
Not everything needs the full Bloc overhead. Theme mode and locale are simple, synchronous, app-wide values — `ValueNotifier` is the right tool. Bloc is reserved for async feature state (data loading, mutations, errors). `setState` is **not used anywhere** in the codebase.

    └── widgets/            # Reusable UI components
```

## Offline-First Sync

All data operations write to the local Drift database immediately. The sync layer operates asynchronously:

1. Every write is recorded in a `sync_queue` table with operation type, table name, record ID, and JSON payload.
2. `ConnectivityService` monitors network state via `connectivity_plus`.
3. When online, `SyncService` processes the queue FIFO, pushing to Firestore under `factory_backup/{tableName}/records/{recordId}`.
4. Failed operations retry up to 3 times, then are marked as `failed`.
5. A visual indicator in the app bar shows sync state: green (synced), spinning (syncing), orange (pending), red (failed).
6. On first launch, a one-time pull restores data from Firestore to the local database.

> **No custom backend.** Firebase Auth handles authentication; Firestore is used exclusively as a remote backup target.

---

## Database Schema

Local database uses **Drift** (SQLite) with 17 tables across schema version **8** (incremental migrations):

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `workers` | Active/inactive worker records |
| `worker_production_entries` | Daily stitch counts |
| `worker_advances` | Advances with carry-over |
| `worker_deductions` | Payroll deductions |
| `stitch_rates` | Rate per 100K stitches (dated) |
| `worker_absent_days` | Absence tracking |
| `women_staff_members` | Fixed-salary staff |
| `staff_advances` | Staff advances with carry-over |
| `staff_deductions` | Staff payroll deductions |
| `suppliers` | Thread supplier records |
| `thread_purchases` | Itemized thread purchases |
| `supplier_payments` | Payments to suppliers |
| `clients` | Client records |
| `client_models` | Order models (piece count, price) |
| `client_payments` | Payments from clients |
| `maintenance_fault_records` | Machine fault logs |
| `sync_queue` | Offline sync operation queue |

---

## Responsive Design

| Breakpoint | Range | Layout |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Mobile | < 600px | BottomNavigationBar |
| Tablet | 600–1024px | Adaptive condensed NavigationRail |
| Desktop | > 1024px | Persistent NavigationRail sidebar |

All form sheets and dialogs use adaptive presentation (bottom sheet on mobile, centered dialog on desktop).

---

## Performance Highlights

- Offline-first eliminates network latency for all reads.
- Drift provides compiled, type-safe SQL with Stream-based reactive updates.
- Bloc ensures widgets rebuild only on their specific state slice.
- `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` preserves tab state across navigation.
- Code-generated DI (`injectable`) resolves dependencies at compile time — no reflection.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Unit and widget test coverage for all features
- [ ] Integration tests for critical workflows (worker payroll, client invoicing)
- [ ] Rich notifications for sync failures
- [ ] Data export via email/cloud share
- [ ] Multi-user support with role-based access
- [ ] Barcode/QR scanning for inventory items
- [ ] Automated backup to additional cloud providers
- [ ] Performance profiling for large datasets (10K+ records)
